The easiest way to run this application is to download love2d (It only takes up around 10mb) and create a shortcut for love.exe to desktop screen, then drag this folder onto the love shortcut icon, it should popup the game startscreen and you're ready to play. The GUI is not well-designed right now, I'll improve it later.
